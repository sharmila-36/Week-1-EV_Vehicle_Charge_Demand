🚗 EV Adoption Forecasting
This project aims to forecast the future adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using historical vehicle registration data from Washington State. With the growing push for sustainable transport, forecasting EV growth is crucial for urban planning and infrastructure development, especially for EV charging stations.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - EV Population Size 2024

Features include:

Date, County, State

Vehicle type (Passenger/Truck)

BEVs, PHEVs, Non-Electric counts

Percent of EVs vs non-EVs

🛠️ What’s Done
Data cleaning (date conversion, handling nulls)

Capped outliers in Percent Electric Vehicles using IQR

Prepared the dataset for modeling (further modeling steps may follow)

📁 Files
ev_forecasting.ipynb – main notebook containing the analysis and data preprocessing steps.

✅ Future Improvements
Implement regression model to forecast EV counts

Evaluate and compare model performance

Visualize trends and prediction confidence
